CubbyFlow is voxel-based fluid simulation engine for computer games based on [Jet framework](https://github.com/doyubkim/fluid-engine-dev) that was created by [Doyub Kim](https://twitter.com/doyub).
The code is built on C++17 and can be compiled with commonly available compilers such as g++, clang++, or Microsoft Visual Studio. CubbyFlow currently supports macOS (10.12.6 or later), Ubuntu (17.04 or later), Windows (Visual Studio 2017 or later), and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Other untested platforms that support C++17 also should be able to build CubbyFlow.

## Key Features

- Basic math and geometry operations and data structures
- Spatial query accelerators
- SPH and PCISPH fluid simulators
- Stable fluids-based smoke simulator
- Level set-based liquid simulator
- PIC, FLIP, and APIC fluid simulators
- Upwind, ENO, and FMM level set solvers
- Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR, MG, CG, ICCG, and MGPCG linear system solvers
- Spherical, SPH, Zhu & Bridson, and Anisotropic kernel for points-to-surface converter
- Converters between signed distance function and triangular mesh
- C++ and Python API
- Intel TBB, OpenMP, HPX and C++11 multi-threading backends

Every simulator has both 2-D and 3-D implementations.

## Quick Start

You will need CMake to build the code. If you're using Windows, you need Visual Studio 2017 in addition to CMake.

First, clone the code:

```
git clone https://github.com/utilForever/CubbyFlow.git --recursive
cd CubbyFlow
```

### C++ API

For macOS or Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

For Windows:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
MSBuild CubbyFlow.sln /p:Configuration=Release
```

Now run some examples, such as:

```
bin/HybridLiquidSim
```

### Python API

Build and install the package by running

```
pip install -U .
```

### Docker

```
docker pull utilforever/cubbyflow:latest
```

Now run hybrid simulation example:

```
docker run -it utilforever/cubbyflow
[inside docker container]
/app/build/bin/HybridLiquidSim
```

### More Instructions of Building the Code

To learn how to build, test, and install the SDK, please check out [INSTALL.md](./Documents/Install.md).

## Documentation

All the documentations for the framework can be found from [the project website](https://utilforever.github.io/CubbyFlow/) incluing the API reference.

## Examples

Here are some of the example simulations generated using CubbyFlow framework. Corresponding example codes can be found under [Examples](./Examples). All images are rendered using [Mitsuba renderer](https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/) and the Mitsuba scene files can be found from [the demo directory](./Demos). Find out more demos from [the project website](https://utilforever.github.io/CubbyFlow/Examples).
