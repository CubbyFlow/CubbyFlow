//! \brief 2-D single-phase pressure solver.
//!
//! This class implements 2-D single-phase pressure solver. This solver encodes
//! the boundaries like Lego blocks -- if a grid cell center is inside or
//! outside the boundaries, it is either marked as occupied or not.
//! In addition, this class solves single-phase flow, solving the pressure for
//! selected fluid region only and treat other area as an atmosphere region.
//! Thus, the pressure outside the fluid will be set to a constant value and
//! velocity field won't be altered. This solver also computes the fluid
//! boundary in block-like manner; If a grid cell is inside or outside the
//! fluid, it is marked as either fluid or atmosphere. Thus, this solver in
//! general, does not compute sub-grid structure.
//!

    //! \brief Solves the pressure term and apply it to the velocity field.
    //!
    //! This function takes input velocity field and outputs pressure-applied
    //! velocity field. It also accepts extra arguments such as \p boundarySDF
    //! and \p fluidSDF that represent signed-distance representation of the
    //! boundary and fluid area. The negative region of \p boundarySDF means
    //! it is occupied by solid object. Also, the positive / negative area of
    //! the \p fluidSDF means it is occupied by fluid / atmosphere. If not
    //! specified, constant scalar field with std::numeric_limits<double>::max()
    //! will be used for \p boundarySDF meaning that no boundary at all.
    //! Similarly, a constant field with -std::numeric_limits<double>::max()
    //! will be used for \p fluidSDF which means it's fully occupied with fluid
    //! without any atmosphere.
    //!
    //! \param[in]    input                 The input velocity field.
    //! \param[in]    timeIntervalInSeconds The time interval for the sim.
    //! \param[inout] output                The output velocity field.
    //! \param[in]    boundarySDF           The SDF of the boundary.
    //! \param[in]    boundaryVelocity      The velocity of the boundary.
    //! \param[in]    fluidSDF              The SDF of the fluid/atmosphere.
    //! \param[in]    useCompressed         True if it uses compressed system.
