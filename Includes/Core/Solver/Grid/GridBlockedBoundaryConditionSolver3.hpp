//! This class constrains the velocity field by projecting the flow to the
//! blocked representation of the collider. A collider is rasterized into voxels
//! and each face of the collider voxels projects the velocity field onto its
//! face. This implementation should pair up with GridSinglePhasePressureSolver3
//! since the pressure solver assumes blocked boundary representation as well.
