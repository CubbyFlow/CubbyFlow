//! \brief 3-D Fluid-Implicit Particle (FLIP) implementation.
//!
//! This class implements 3-D Fluid-Implicit Particle (FLIP) solver from the
//! SIGGRAPH paper, Zhu and Bridson 2005. By transferring delta-velocity field
//! from grid to particles, the FLIP solver achieves less viscous fluid flow
//! compared to the original PIC method.

    //! results when transferring velocity from grids to particles in order to
    //! reduce the noise. The factor can be a value between 0 and 1, where 0
    //! means no blending and 1 means full PIC. Default is 0.
